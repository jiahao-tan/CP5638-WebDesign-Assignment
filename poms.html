						<p>Poms from Oz are Judy, Kathleen and Alan Pomeroy, a family of solo vocalists from North Queensland, Australia. All are dinky di Oz with Judy and Kathy being descendents of First Fleeters. <br>
						  <br>
						  Their tight harmony and vocal strength bring a fresh feel to original, contemporary and traditional works, uncovering a rich tapestry of songs gathered in their travels from around the world. Most songs are a cappella but sometimes accompanied by guitar and/or harmonica. Moods in their songs range from downright to real tear jerkers and audience participation is encouraged. Their sound is distinctive, as Judy arranges all the songs specifically for their voices. <br>
						  <br>
					    A tast brew of Oz songs and Oz voices, with a dash of guitar and harmonica. Open a nice bottle of red , sit back and enjoy.  For further information or bookings contact the Music Centre 4724 2086
